# Weather data tools
A js library with utilities to work with weather data. Basically push current condition readings into provided classes and they will provide time filtered conditions in proper perspective. example: averaged windspeed 5 minutes or rainfall 24 hours. Most of the conditions can be filtered with a timeSpan of seconds in history from now.

For example:





## Classes

condition
: base class for tracking a condition using an array of observations filterable by timeSpan.  Class is designed around an array of observations stored by unix date time key. The class includes typical array functions like avg, min, max, span.

rain
: rain accumulation 5m,1h,12h,24h using a static rain value

wind_speed
: gust and avg speed

wind_dir
: avg, cardinal, static cardinalFromDegree 

temperature:
: avg

humidity
: avg
